# Entropic Projects
> A collection of small projects that I have worked on that didn't get big enough to demand their own repositories.

## Summary of the projects
### workload
- A tool for assessing the current and predicted workload of VATSIM controllers using the traffic API. In particular, creates heat maps using LeafletJS showing the level of traffic over the next 15/30/1h/3h period based on live flights.
- Similar concept as ``tmtv``, although more targeted towards a quick demo of how this data could be used by individual ATCOs, rather than in a overview capacity by a dedicated flow controller.

### 787display
- A HTML/CSS rendition of the 787's electronic flight bag.
- This seemed like a good idea at the time, but the reality of turning it into a functional application is quite different.
